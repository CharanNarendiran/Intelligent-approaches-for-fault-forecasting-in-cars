# Intelligent-approaches-for-fault-forecasting-in-cars
• Authored a research paper focusing on machine learning techniques, particularly K-Nearest Neighbors
algorithm, to predict automotive failures. This research is based on three datasets.
• Developed a comprehensive system utilizing key parameters, to anticipate potential issues. Demonstrated the
effectiveness of the model through rigorous testing and evaluation, achieving an accuracy of 98 percentage.
• When a user enters the details of a car that is based on features involved in the model, it will produce the
prediction of fault.
